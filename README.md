A simple python script to combine time-ordered figures into a 4x4 gridded matplotlib figure.

The only prerequisite to use this script would be to rename the input images in the 'items' directory
from 1 to 16 based on prefered order.

The following can be adjusted:

1. Color schemes
2. DPI
3. Image file format
4. Item descriptions
5. Grid numberings

Instructions:

1. Add images to the 'items' directory
2. Change the script's working directory to the 'items' directory
3. Make preferred adjustments and run the code
