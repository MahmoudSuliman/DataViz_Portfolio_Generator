A simple python script to combine time-ordered figures into a 4x4 gridded matplotlib figure.

The only prerequisite to use this script would be to rename the input images in the 'items' directory
from 1 to 16 based on prefered order.

The following can be adjusted:

1. Color schemes

2. DPI

3. Image file format

4. Item descriptions

5. Grid numberings
